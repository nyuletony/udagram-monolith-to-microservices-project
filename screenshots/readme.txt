I used GitHub actions in place of Travis as it is a free tool and works the same.

My AWS credits got exhausted before I took the screesnshot of kubectl logs {pod_name}
I did the same cluster deployment on another AWS cloud gateway with the same configurations, but the pods keep 
crushing. I have tried to debug for almost 2 weeks but I have not been successful.

#attention item corrected:
I have corrected the credentials secrets and I have been able to have the backend pods running withouth crushing.
I have also been able to get the logs in one of the backed pods - a screeshot is attached.
