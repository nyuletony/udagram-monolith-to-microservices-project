I used GitHub actions in place of Travis as it is a free tool and works the same.

My AWS credits got exhausted before I took the screesnshot of kubectl logs {pod_name}
I did the same cluster deployment on another AWS cloud gateway with the same configurations, but the pods keep 
crushing. I have tried to debug for almost 2 weeks but I have not been successful.
